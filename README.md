Instructions

### Instructions
1. Slide heartbeat signal vs. Boeing stock data slider (upper right) back and forth to see a
heartbeat buried in high-amplitude stock data

2. Click ‘Audio toggle’ to hear a sonified representation of this effect, where sonified stock
data buries the sound of the heart

3. Press space bar to trigger an ‘impulse’, which charges up a capacitor. The capacitor’s
charge state determines the mixing ratio for the heartbeat and stock data and audio.

4. Adjust resistor slider (lower right) to change the charge rate of the emotional capacitor. A
higher resistor value will result in slower charge rate and reduced peak voltage achieved
for the given impulse
